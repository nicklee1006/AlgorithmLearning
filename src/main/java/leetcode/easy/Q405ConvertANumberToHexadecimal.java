/**
 * Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer,
 * twoâ€™s complement method is used.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
 * The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented
 * by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not
 * be the zero character.
 * The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex
 * directly.
 *
 * hint:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal/discuss/89253/Simple-Java-solution-with-comment
 *
 * Solution
 * 1. Each time take a look at the last digits of the number, and convert it to a hex char
 * 2. Shift the number to right for 4 bits
 * 3. Do again until no bits left
